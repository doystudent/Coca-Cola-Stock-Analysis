Finance through excel.\nI started off by organizing the variables so that we can see how the date connects to the price of the stocks by year. now we can determine if Coca Cola Stocks have a good trend line and it’s safe to say that soon, there may be a drop again but it will definitely rise back up in around 10-20 years."
