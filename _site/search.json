Finance through excel.\nI started off by organizing the variables so that we can see how the date connects to the price of the stocks by year. Now we can determine if Coca Cola Stocks have a good trend line and it’s safe to say that soon, there may be a drop in the next 5 - 10 years again but it will definitely rise back up in around 10-20 years based off of it’s patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see some other stocks to compare.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe famous Pepsi vs. Coke\n\n# Start off with something about Coke like when it started for example\n# 1. Investing, If you drink Coke everyday you may start thinking about Coke stocks\n\n# Then say something about the Plot\n# 2. While analyzing data there has been many ups and downs and around 2003 and 2020 stocks dropped most likely due to nervous investors and Covid.\n\n# \n# Put everything in R script\n#"
